I'm a Senior Data Scientist at [Penn Medicine](http://www.pennmedicine.org/) where I'm building machine learning systems to improve patient outcomes by providing real-time predictive applications that empower clinicians to identify at risk individuals. In my spare time I organize the [DataPhilly Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/DataPhilly/) group and despite being terrified of public speaking I present regularly at community events and conferences.

If you have found any of my work useful and would like to donate to my "bring on the singularity fund" (in either bitcoins or money), please use the button below.
