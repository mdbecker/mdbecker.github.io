I'm a Data Engineer at [AWeber](http://aweber.jobs/) and founder of the [DataPhilly Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/DataPhilly/) group. On a day to day basis, I spend a majority of my time acquiring, scrubbing, exploring, and visualizing data. I love machine learning and I get my kicks out of clustering, regression and classification algorithms.
