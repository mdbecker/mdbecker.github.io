I'm a Data Engineer at [AWeber](http://aweber.jobs/) and founder of the [DataPhilly Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/DataPhilly/) group. On a day to day basis, I spend a majority of my time acquiring, scrubbing, exploring, and visualizing data. I love machine learning and I get my kicks out of clustering, regression and classification algorithms.

If you have found any of my work useful and would like to donate to my "bring on the singularity fund" (in either bitcoins or money), please use the button below.
